myPhotoGallery
==============

I've been using and extending FuzzyMonkey's My Photo Gallery set of scripts for my own whim. Mostly I've been changing the offline processing of the photos and videos. I've been starting to take pictures in RAW format and want to generate JPEGs out of them and after a month or so I can remove the RAW file since if I were to play with the RAW file I would have done so already. I've also added a feature to create thumbnails for videos too.
